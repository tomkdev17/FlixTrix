# HarmONics

HarmONics is an API that allows Users to be able to interface with a small musical database created with MongoDB. The User can request information about songs, artists, and genres, as well as add their favorite songs to their own list! There's even potential in the future for Users to be able to submit their own entries to the database, which could be a gamechanger for local music scenes. 

With all this being said, this API uses the MERN stack modeled with Mongoose in order to process HTTP requests and deliver information about music. The supported HTTP requests can be found in the documentation file.  

  P.S. - This is my first project doing any backend development
