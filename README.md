# FlixTrix

This project is my first foray into backend programming!

The basic goals of the project at this point are to create a server/API that will allow users to get information about everything relating to film. 
This could include films, directors, actors, genres, and other information. 
The users should then be able to store their favorite information in an account that they can manage through the application. 

Later on, I'll be building the application itself (The best movie application ever made, probably) and it will be my first ever project that can stand alone.

I'm excited to see what I can do, and share it with all of you!

This project will be created using Node.js and employ REST architecture, MongoDB and Heroku for modeling and deployment.
